# The Qianqin Containers Library

Popular applications, provided by [Qianqiu](https://github.com/qianqiu-labs), containerized and ready to launch.

## Get an image

The recommended way to get any of the Qianqiu Images is to pull the prebuilt image from the Docker Hub Registry.

```shell
docker pull qianqiu/APP
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag.

```shell
docker pull qianqiu/APP:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself by cloning the repository, changing to the directory containing the Dockerfile, and executing the docker build command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/qianqiu-labs/container-images.git
cd qianqiu/APP/VERSION/OPERATING-SYSTEM
docker build -t qianqiu/APP .
```

> Remember to replace the APP, VERSION, and OPERATING-SYSTEM placeholders in the example command above with the correct values.
